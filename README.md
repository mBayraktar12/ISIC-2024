Participating in this Kaggle competition was an important experience for me. I initially ranked 16th out of 2700 participants on the public leaderboard, which was exciting. However, when the private leaderboard was revealed, I dropped to 215th place. This was likely due to poor submission selection and perhaps too much hyperparameter tuning because my approach was completely leak-free. (My other submission which I unselected just 3 minutes before the deadline could have won a silver medal.)
